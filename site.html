                    The Problem

                <p>
                    Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
                    An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.
